**Project Title: Medical Data Analysis and Visualization using SQL and Power BI**

**Summary:**

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of medical data using SQL queries on two tables, 'hospitalisation' and 'medical_examinations.' The primary focus was on understanding customer health, treatment, and associated charges over multiple years.

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - Identified and handled null values, checked data types, and removed duplicates.
   - Renamed and cleaned columns for clarity and consistency.

2. **Medical Data Analysis:**
   - Conducted various SQL queries to extract valuable insights:
     - Calculated averages, totals, and percentages.
     - Identified customers with specific health conditions.
     - Analyzed trends in BMI, charges, and major surgeries.
   
3. **Complex Analyses:**
   - Implemented more advanced queries:
     - Leveraged Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for yearly averages and hospitalization counts.
     - Used window functions for cumulative charges and ranking.
     - Conducted analyses on fluctuating BMI levels and consistent frequent treatments.

4. **Power BI Visualization:**
   - The SQL insights were complemented by visualizations created in Power BI.
   - Utilized Power BI's interactive dashboards and reports for a more intuitive understanding of the data.
   - Visualized trends, relationships, and key metrics, enhancing the interpretability of the analysis.

5. **Project Insights:**
   - Discovered patterns and trends in customer health and treatment over the years.
   - Identified specific customer segments with high charges, health issues, and frequent treatments.
   - Analyzed the distribution of charges across different tiers and years.

**Conclusion:**
This project provided valuable insights into the medical data through SQL analysis and enhanced data visualization using Power BI. The combination of SQL queries and interactive visualizations enabled a comprehensive understanding of customer health, treatment patterns, and associated charges. This integrated approach is instrumental in deriving actionable insights for medical practitioners and administrators.
